**Ideal for practicing:**
- ETL workflows (Extract, Transform, Load).
- Dashboard design (KPIs, maps, trends, comparisons).
- Data storytelling (customer segmentation, product performance, regional analysis).

  - Analyze sales trends, customer segments, and product performance etc.
   **Data Modeling**
